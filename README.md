#POKESCAPE

##Game Summary

A race against the clock and your opponent to get inside the building undetected!  If you're spotted, RUN! or PUSH! Then go run and push your opponent into some grass to slow 'em down!

Pokescape was created for the first project at General Assembly WDI.  The project assignment was to create any type of game using the HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery skills we learned during the previous two weeks.  The game was completed in 5 days.

## Game Engine

Pokescape was developed using sprite animations on HTML5 Canvas with CSS and Javascript/JQuery.  The game engine was created as part of the project.  No third party game engine frameworks were used.
